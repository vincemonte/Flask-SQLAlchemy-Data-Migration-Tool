I've just started the initial steps in creating a tool that can take data from SQL Alchemy tables and convert it to JSON. The JSON will later be used to migrate the data back into a newly designed schema for my website database.

As of tonight, I just wanted to get my own data ready for the site revamp, but this will eventually be made to where anyone can use it on their .db Alchemy files.
